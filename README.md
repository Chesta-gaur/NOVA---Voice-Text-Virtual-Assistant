🧠 NOVA – Python Voice & Text Virtual Assistant

NOVA is a desktop-based virtual assistant developed using Python, designed to interact with users through both voice and text.
It demonstrates real-world concepts such as speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, GUI development, multithreading, and modular architecture.

This project focuses on clean separation of logic and interface, scalability, and user experience.
